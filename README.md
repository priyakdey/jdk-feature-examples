# JDK Feature Examples

Examples of new features of JDK 9+.

I need to manage different jdk versions under one repository and
also try and build them.
For build tool, I will using gradle but at each project level.
The top level directory is nothing more than a directory.

To achieve this, the idea is to use docker and isolate each environment.
Later I will try and automate running test cases against each version
using Docker SDK For Python.
